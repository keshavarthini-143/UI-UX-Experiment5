# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:

To identify user pain points, write clear UX problem statements, choose appropriate research methods, and create user personas for two apps (a Government Service app and a Health app) to produce a ready-to-submit UX lab report.


## Algorithm:

1.Select scenarios choose the two apps: Government Service (UMANG) and Health (Doctor/Health Checker).

2.Gather initial observations review screenshots and jot common user complaints (form confusion, long login).

3.Identify pain points list concrete user problems for each scenario.

4.Write problem statements use the template:
"[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

5.Choose research methods pick methods per scenario (e.g., interviews, usability testing, surveys, A/B testing) and write brief justifications.

6.Create personas craft at least two personas (demographics, goals, behaviors, pain points, motivation) representing typical users.

7.Prepare deliverables compile content into a PDF lab report and add images; create a GitHub repo and upload the PDF.

8.Summarize outputs list files, repo URL, and a short conclusion for submission.

The output of this experiment includes two fully analyzed UX project scenarios a Government Service App (UMANG) and a Health Tracking App along with their user pain points, problem statements, selected research methods, and created user personas.This experiment helped in understanding how UX design is not only about visual appearance but also about identifying real-world user challenges and finding human-centered solutions through research and design thinking.

## 1. Scenario 1: Government Service App (UMANG)

The chosen government application provides multiple services like Aadhaar, DigiLocker, and Railway inquiries. However, users often face issues while filling online forms and following the application procedures.

## Observed User Problems:

1.Users struggle to understand the procedure for filling and submitting forms.

2.There is no tutorial or proper guidance in the interface.

3.Navigation between different services is confusing and not beginner-friendly.

## Problem Statement:

Citizens need a way to understand how to fill government service forms step-by-step because the current portal lacks clear tutorials and guidance, which results in errors, incomplete submissions, and user frustration.

## Selected Research Methods:

User Interviews: To collect real feedback from citizens about their experience while using the government portal.

Usability Testing: To watch users performing tasks on the app and identify exact points where they face difficulty.

## Expected Outcome:
By conducting interviews and usability testing, the UX designer can simplify navigation, include step-by-step tutorials, and design a more guided process for completing applications smoothly.

## Persona 1: Rajesh Kumar (Government App User)

Age: 45

Occupation: Small Business Owner

Location: Chennai

Goals: Wants to renew business licenses and certificates easily.

Behaviors: Uses mobile often but gets confused with government sites.

Pain Points: No proper guidance or step-by-step help.

Motivation: Needs a simple, mobile-friendly portal with tutorials.

## 2. Scenario 2: Health Tracking / Doctor Appointment App

This health application allows users to book appointments, check daily health parameters, and get reminders. However, the major issue is the long login process, even for basic health check features.

## Observed User Problems:

1.Users are forced to log in before accessing simple features like BMI or heart rate check.

2.Many users skip using the app due to lengthy verification steps.

3.The process reduces user engagement and leads to app abandonment.

## Problem Statement:

Users need a way to access basic health check features without logging in because the long login process delays quick health checks, which results in user drop-off and poor engagement.

Selected Research Methods:

Online Surveys: To gather user opinions about login issues and preferences for quick access features.

A/B Testing: To compare two versions of the app (with and without login) and measure which gives a better user experience.

## Expected Outcome:
The UX designer can use survey and testing results to redesign the login flow â€” allowing guest access for quick health checks and encouraging users to register later for advanced features.

## Persona 2: Priya Sharma (Health App User)

Age: 26

Occupation: IT Professional

Location: Bangalore

Goals: Quickly check daily health status and book doctor appointments.

Behaviors: Tech-savvy but prefers quick access.

Pain Points: Login and registration take too much time.

Motivation: Wants an app that gives instant access to basic features without login.
## 3. Visual Output

Screenshots of both the selected apps UMANG App (Government Service Portal) and Health Tracking App (Doctor Appointment) are included in the report to visually support the scenarios discussed.
Each image represents the user interface of the chosen application and helps illustrate the user problems identified during analysis.



## Result:

The experiment produced a complete UX analysis for both scenarios: clear, actionable problem statements; justified research methods to validate and refine designs; and two well-defined personas to guide design decisions. These outputs are ready to be packaged into a PDF lab report and uploaded to a GitHub repository for submission.
